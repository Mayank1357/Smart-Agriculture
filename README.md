# IoT-Farming
An IOT solution for agriculture monitoring, analysis and recommendation system

# To open the Proteus simulation
You need to have <b>Proteus 8.5+</b>

Download and open  `Proteus/IoT-Farming.pdsprj`

To run the simulation you need to add the hex file to the microcontroller. To do that;
<ol>
  <li>
      Download the files from <code>Atmel Studio</code> folder
  </li>
  <li>
      Go to the Proteus simulation and right click on the microcontroller. Then click on <code>Edit Properties</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Click on <code>folder icon</code> next to <code>Program Fle</code> option. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Browse and add <code>.hex</code> file. It can be found in <code>Atmel Studio/Iot-Farming/Debug</code> folder
  </li>
</ol>

You can edit the code in Atmel Studio and compile it to make changes to the simulations. You need Atmel Studio for that.
